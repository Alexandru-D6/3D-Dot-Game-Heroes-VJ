# 3D Dot Game Heroes

This is a small game made for the subject [VJ](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VJ) using the game engine [Unity](https://unity.com/es).

The main goal of this project was to replicate the original game [3D Dot Game Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Dot_Game_Heroes). You can find all the implemented features and a more in-depth explanation in the [PDF](/Memoria/memoria.pdf) (written in spanish). Here's a quick summary:
 - 4 different types of enemies
 - Various weapons for the main character (sword, bow, bommerang, etc)
 - A final boss fight
 - Puzzles!
 - All models were created from scratch using [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)

You can watch a short [teaser](/Demo/Demo%203D%20Dot%20Game%20Heroes.mp4) or play it yourself using the [binaries](/Binari/3D%20dot%20Game%20Hero.exe).

All the source code is available in the [3D Dot Game Hero](/3D%20dot%20Game%20Hero/) folder, and you can easily import it to unity using the version 2021.3.13f1. Newer version should also work, but they have not been tested.
